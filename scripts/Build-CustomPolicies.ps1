.SYNOPSIS
   Build the Trusted Framework policies for each defined environment
.DESCRIPTION
   The script replaces the keys with the value configure in the appsettings.json file contains the keys with their values for each environment:
    •Name - contains the environment name which VS code extension uses to create the environment folder (under the environments parent folder). Use your operation system legal characters only.
    •Tenant - specifies the tenant name, such as contoso.onmicrosoft.com. In the policy file, use the format of Settings:Tenant, for example {Settings:Tenant}.
    •Production - (boolean) is preserved for future use, indicating whether the environment is a production one.
    •PolicySettings - contains a collection of key-value pair with your settings. In the policy file, use the format of Settings: and the key name, for example {Settings:FacebookAppId}.
